Word
worse things could happen than being stranded in the middle of nowhere during a rainstorm
I could be on the run from a rabid bear that wanted to maul me right into the next century
or I could be tied to a chair in a dark basement and forced to listen to aqua's barbie girl over and over until I'd rather gnaw my arm off than hear the chorus again
but just because things could get worse didn't mean it wasn't bad now
stop
think positive
a car will appear now
i stared at my phone and bit my teeth in pure frustration as the app assured me it found my car just like it had for the last half hour
normally I wouldn't be too stressed about it all since at least I had a working phone and a bus shelter that mostly protected me from the whipping rain
but josh's going away party was starting in an hour i still hadn't picked up the surprise cake from the bakery and it was getting dark soon
I may be a glass is half full girl but I wasn't stupid
no one especially not a college girl with zero self defense skills worth mentioning wants to be alone in the middle of nowhere after dark
i should have taken self defense classes with jules she had said
I mentally scrolled through my limited options
the bus that stopped here didn't run on weekends and most of my friends didn't have a car
bridget had car service but she was at an event at the embassy until seven
my rideshare app wasn't working and I hadn't seen a single car drive by since it started raining
not that i would hitchhike anyway i have seen my fair share of horror movies thank you very much
I only had one option left one that I really didn't want to use but you have no other options so I found the contact in the phone said a silent prayer and pressed the call button
a ringtone
two ringtones
three
come on answer
or not
i wasn't sure what was worse being murdered or facing my brother
of course there was always a chance my brother would kill me anyway for putting me in this situation but i could deal with that later
what happened I wrinkled my nose at his greeting
hello to you with dearest brother
what makes you think something is wrong josh snorted
uh you called me
you never call unless you're in a bad mood
it was true
we preferred texting and we didn't live next door my idea by the way so we rarely needed to send any messages at all
"I wouldn't say I'm in trouble, I said"
more that I am stranded
I'm not near public transport and I can't get a carpool in the app
oh my god
where are you I told him
what the hell are you doing there it's an hour from campus wasn't that dramatic
i had an engagement shoot and it's a half hour drive
three quarters if there is a lot of traffic
the thunder thundered and shook the branches of the nearby trees
I backed off and pulled myself further into the cure not because it did any immediate good
it rained sideways and splashed water drops on me that were so heavy and hard that they stung when they hit the skin
a rustling sound was heard from josh's side followed by a soft moan
I stopped myself sure I had heard wrong but no there it was again
another moan
my eyes widened in horror
are you having sex or both I whispered and shouted at the same time even though no one else was around
the sandwich I had stuffed into me before leaving for the shoot threatened to resurface
there was nothing I repeat nothing worse than hearing a family member in the middle of intercourse
just the thought made me want to throw up
technically no
josh didn't exactly sound contrite
the word technical was quite significant in the context
it didn't take a genius to decipher josh's vague answer
maybe he wasn't having intercourse but something was going on and I had no desire to find out what this something was
josh chen
you it was you who called me
he must have covered the phone with his hand because what he said next was only muffled
i heard a soft feminine laugh followed by a scream and i wanted to turn white my ears my eyes my thoughts
one of the guys took my car to buy more ice josh said his voice clear again
but don't worry i will fix it
drop a pin on your exact spot and make sure you have the phone in your hand
do you still have the pepper spray that you got as a birthday present from me last year yes
thanks for that by the way
i had wanted a new camera bag but josh had bought me an eight pack of pepper spray instead
I had never used any of them which meant that all eight bottles minus the one in my purse were in the closet
my sarcasm went over my brother's head
"for a medical student with the highest grades, he could be quite stupid"
it was nothing
stay where you are and he will come soon
we can talk about your total lack of self-preservation later
"I'm self-preserved, I protested"
was that the right word it's not my fault there's no wait what do you mean he josh too late
he had already hung up
typical that he abandoned me for one of his bedfellows the only time I wanted him to develop something
i was surprised he hadn't freaked out more considering josh was anything but overprotective
ever since the incident he had taken it upon himself to look after me as if he were my brother and bodyguard in one
i didn't blame him our childhood had been a hundred shades of messed up or so i'd been told anyway and i loved him but his constant worry could be a little too much
i sat on the bench and pushed the bag against me letting the cracked leather warm my skin as i waited for the mysterious he to appear
it could be anyone
josh had plenty of friends
he had always been popular basketball player student council president and homecoming king in high school part of the sigma fraternity and a favorite on campus in college
I was the complete opposite
not unpopular per se but I shunned the limelight and preferred a small group of close friends to a large group of kind acquaintances
where josh was the center of the party i sat in a corner and daydreamed about all the places i would like to visit but probably would never manage to get to
not if my phobia was allowed to continue to decide
my damn phobia
i knew it was mental but it felt physical
the nausea the palpitations the paralyzing fear that turned my legs and arms into useless stiff things the positive thing was that at least I wasn't afraid of rain
seas lakes and pools I could avoid but rain yes it would have been bad
i wasn't sure how long i sat in the little bus stop cursing my lack of foresight when i declined the grayson couple's offer to drive me back to town after our shoot
i hadn't wanted to bother them but thought i could call a car and be back on the thayer campus in half an hour but the heavens had opened right after the couple left and yes here i was
